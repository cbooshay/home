\section*{About \begin{small}\begin{color}{gray} (\today)\end{color}\end{small}}

The target audience for the writings on this site is undergraduate mathematics students, especially those at the institution where I work, Salem State University. 

This site serves two purposes. First, I hope it will show curious students perspectives and directions that they are unlikely to have seen in their classes and to encourage in them the sense of play and experimentation that seems to me so central in the practice of mathematics. Second, it gives me an outlet for writing on interesting pieces of mathematics that, for the most part, don't come up in the classes I teach but fall short (usually well short) of anything publishable. Happy reading.
