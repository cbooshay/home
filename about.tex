\section*{About \begin{small}\begin{color}{gray} (\today)\end{color}\end{small}}

The target audience for the writings on this site is undergraduate mathematics students, especially those at the institution where I work, Salem State University. 

This site serves two purposes. First, it gives me an outlet for writing on interesting little mathematical tidbits that, for the most part, don't come up in the classes I teach but fall short (usually well short) of anything publishable. Second, I hope it will show curious students perspectives and directions that they are unlikely to have taken in their classes.
