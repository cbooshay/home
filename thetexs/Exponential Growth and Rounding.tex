\section*{Exponential Growth and Rounding \begin{small} \begin{color}{gray} (July 15, 2024) \end{color} \end{small}}

Suppose the population of a bacteria culture $t$ hours after it is activated is well modeled by the function 
\[
  f(t) = 100 e^{.04 t}
\]
You may recognize this as an example of an exponential growth model. In 20 hours, the size of the culture will be approximately
\[
  f(20) = 100 e^{(.04)(20)} \approx 1113
\]
Often, the growth constant, $\ds .04$ is computed or estimated somehow. Suppose in doing this computation, you used one more place of decimal accuracy and obtained the model 
\[
  g(t) = 100 e^{.044 t}
\]
You would compute the size of the culture in 20 hours to be approximately
\[
  g(20) = 100 e^{(.044)(20)} \approx 1205
\]
Our answers are quite different even though our estimates of the growth constant only differed in the third decimal place.

Suppose I compute the growth constant to be $r$, and you compute it to be $s$, and let's say that $\ds r<s$. Then my estimate of the size of the culture in $t$ hours is $\ds 100 e^{rt}$ and yours is $\ds 100 e^{s t}$. Their ratio is
\begin{equation} \label{DecayingExponential}
  \frac{100 e^{r t}}{100 e^{st}} = e^{(r-s) t}
\end{equation}
Because my growth constant is smaller than yours, my estimate will be smaller than yours, but if our estimates are about the same, then the ratio in (\ref{DecayingExponential}) should be about 1. However, the right hand side of (\ref{DecayingExponential}) decays \textit{exponentially}. If your growth constant is $.01$ more than mine, and we wish to estimate the size of the culture in 10 hours, this ratio will be about .9, which means that my estimate is 90\% of yours--a significant difference. If we estimate the size of the culture in 70 hours (less than three days), your estimate will be more than twice as big as mine.
