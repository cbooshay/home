\section*{Wordle and the Wolfram Language \begin{small} \begin{color}{gray} \\
(August 27, 2024) \end{color} \end{small}}

The Wolfram Language's built in \verb# DictionaryLookup[] # function allows for some optimization of strategy at the game of Wordle, in which players attempt to guess a five-letter word, being informed after each guess what letters the hidden word has in common with their guess and whether those letters are in the correct position. Running

\begin{verbatim}
Select[DictionaryLookup[], StringLength[#] == 5 &] // Length
\end{verbatim}

\noi reveals that there are $6789$ five-letter English words (at least in the Wolfram Language's dictionary). We can determine the number of occurrences of each letter of the alphabet in these words via

\begin{verbatim}
Reverse[
 SortBy[
  Tally[
   Flatten[
    Characters /@ 
     Select[DictionaryLookup[], StringLength[#] == 5 &]]], 
  Last]
 ]\end{verbatim}
 
This reports that the five most common letters are, in decreasing order of frequency, ``e", ``s", ``a", ``r", and ``o," which in turn suggests that the best opening word would be a five-letter word spelled with those letters. Being a better coder than a speller, I ran 

\begin{verbatim}
Intersection[
 StringJoin /@ Permutations[{"e", "s", "a", "r", "o"}], 
 Select[DictionaryLookup[], StringLength[#] == 5 &]
 ]
 \end{verbatim}

\noi to discover that the only such word is ``arose."
